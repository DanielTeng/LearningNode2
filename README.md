# Learning Node 2nd edition Examples

Subdirectories include example code for the book, "Learning Node, 2nd edition" by Shelley Powers.

Starting in March, examples are being modified/updated/added to account for the Node v4 end of life (EOL), as well as the release of Node v10. 

As each chapter's examples are updated, the chapter is added to the list:

Chapter 1 (chap1)

Chapter 2 (chap2)

Chapter 3 (chap3)

Chapter 4 (chap4)

Chapter 5 (chap5)

If you spot a problem you can contact me, or made the correction in the file and submit the file commit into the master.
